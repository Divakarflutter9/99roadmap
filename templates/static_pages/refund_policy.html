                    At 99Roadmap, we operate a strict No Refund Policy. This policy outlines our stance on refunds and
                    the very limited circumstances under which refunds may be considered.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-white mb-3">1. No Refund Policy</h3>
                <p class="text-secondary mb-4">
                    <strong>All sales are final.</strong> 99Roadmap operates a strict <strong>No Refund Policy</strong>.
                    Once a subscription is purchased and payment is processed, we <strong>do not provide
                        refunds</strong> under normal circumstances. Please carefully review our platform features,
                    content, and pricing before making a purchase decision.
                </p>

                <div class="alert alert-warning mb-4">

                <h3 class="text-white mb-3">2. Rare Exceptions to No Refund Policy</h3>

                <p class="text-secondary mb-3">Refunds will <strong>ONLY</strong> be considered in the following

                <h5 class="text-white mb-2">Limited Exceptions (rare cases only):</h5>
                <ul class="text-secondary mb-3">

                    <li><strong>Verified Billing Error:</strong> If a confirmed system error resulted in charging you an
                        incorrect amount</li>
                </ul>

                <h5 class="text-white mb-2">You are NOT eligible for refunds in these cases:</h5>

                <h3 class="text-white mb-3">3. Subscription Renewals</h3>
                <p class="text-secondary mb-4">
                    <strong>No refunds are provided for subscription renewals</strong> (monthly or annual). It is your
                    responsibility to cancel your subscription before the renewal date if you do not wish to continue.
                    Auto-renewals are clearly disclosed at the time of purchase, and you are responsible for managing
                    your subscription.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-white mb-3">4. How to Request a Refund</h3>
                <p class="text-secondary mb-2">To request a refund, follow these steps:</p>
                <ol class="text-secondary mb-4">
                    <li>Contact our support team via email at <a href="mailto:support@99roadmap.com"
                            class="text-primary">support@99roadmap.com</a> or through our <a href="{% url 'contact' %}"
                            class="text-primary">Contact Us</a> page</li>
                    <li>Include your account email, transaction ID, and reason for refund</li>

                    <li>If approved, the refund will be processed within 5-7 business days</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="text-white mb-3">5. Refund Processing Time</h3>
                <p class="text-secondary mb-4">
                    Once your refund is approved:
                <ul class="text-secondary">
                    <li><strong>Credit/Debit Cards:</strong> 5-7 business days</li>
                    <li><strong>UPI/Wallets:</strong> 3-5 business days</li>

                </ul>
                Please note that the actual time may vary depending on your bank or payment provider.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-white mb-3">6. Partial Refunds</h3>
                <p class="text-secondary mb-4">
                    We do not offer partial refunds for unused portions of a subscription period. If you cancel your
                    subscription mid-cycle, you will retain access until the end of the current billing period, but no
                    refund will be issued for the remaining time.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-white mb-3">7. Cancellation Policy</h3>
                <p class="text-secondary mb-4">
                    You can cancel your subscription at any time from your profile settings. Upon cancellation:
                <ul class="text-secondary">
                    <li>You'll retain access to premium features until the end of your billing period</li>
                    <li>Your subscription will not auto-renew</li>
                    <li>Your account will remain active as a free user</li>
                    <li>Your learning progress and data will be preserved</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-white mb-3">8. Free Trials</h3>
                <p class="text-secondary mb-4">
                    If you sign up for a free trial, you must cancel before the trial period ends to avoid being
                    charged. <strong>No refunds will be provided</strong> if you forget to cancel and are charged after
                    the trial ends. The trial period duration and pricing are clearly stated at the time of signup.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-white mb-3">9. Promotional Offers and Discounts</h3>
                <p class="text-secondary mb-4">
                    Subscriptions purchased with promotional discounts are subject to the same refund policy. Refunds
                    will be issued for the amount actually paid, not the original price before the discount.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-white mb-3">10. Fraudulent Activity</h3>
                <p class="text-secondary mb-4">
                    If we detect fraudulent activity or abuse of our refund policy (such as multiple refund requests
                    from the same user), we reserve the right to deny refunds and terminate the account.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-white mb-3">11. Changes to This Refund Policy</h3>
                <p class="text-secondary mb-4">
                    We reserve the right to modify this Refund Policy at any time. Changes will be effective immediately
                    upon posting on this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
                </p>
